# About

This is the shopping cart project from the Odin Projects Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. See full details here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/shopping-cart

The goal of this assignment was to make a fake web store making use of React Routers. Users can add items to their shopping cart, remove items from their cart, and see their subtotal.

As it stands the checkout button does nothing. In the future I may make it route to a "order confirmed" page.
